# Individual-Project- S&P 500 up or down

## Project description with goals
### Description
* We want to be able to predict the wheter the S&P 500 will be up or down by close on a geven day

### Background Info
* The S&P 500 is a stock market index composed of 500 large companies having common stock listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) or Nasdaq. Founded in 1923, it is now considered one of the best overall indicators of the US stock market.
* There are several investment vehicles offered by various companies that aim to mimic the composition of the S&P 500 and are tradeble under ticker symbols like SPY and SPX
* For this project we will use ^GSPC, which is Yahoo Finance's 'proprietary' ticker for the S&P 500 index. 
    * However, it must be remembered that ^GSPC is a price index and is not tradeable. It only shows the movement of stock prices in the S&P 500 index.

### GoalsÂ¶
* Construct an ML model that predicts S&P 500 Up or Down
* Find the key drivers of S&P 500 movement.
* Deliver a report that the data science team can read through and replicate, understand what steps were taken, why and what the outcome was.
* Make recommendations on what works or doesn't work in predicting the S&P 500 movement up or down.

## Initial hypotheses and/or questions you have of the data, ideas
There should be some combination of features that can be used to build a predictive model wheter the S&P 500 will be up or down on a given day

*****************************************
** Project Plan 
*** Acquire data from Yahoo Finance 
*** Prepare data
    **** Create Engineered columns from existing data

        ***** evaluate database to tidy up 
        ***** address any outliers
*** Explore data in search of drivers of S&P 500 movement
    **** Answer the following initial questions
        ***** 1. ?
        ***** 2. ?
        ***** 3. ? 
        ***** 4. ? 
*** Develop a model to predict S&P500 movement up or down
*** Draw conclusions

## Data Dictionary


## Steps to Reproduce
* 1. Clone this repo.
* 2. Acquire the data from yfinance 
    * use terminal to run pip install yfinance 
* 3. Put the data in the file containing the cloned repo.
* 4. Run notebook.

## Takeaways and Conclusions
* Of the features examined all proved relevant to predicting tax values
* * RMSE proved the best metric for evaluating various models created 
* By combining the features into a series of models I found the Polynomial Regression model was best
* On the test set the model returned a RMSE of 307698.389898 
    * this out performs the baseline RMSE 383891.952694   
* This model could be used in production, but I belive it could be improved further

# Recomendations
* Continue developing the model
* Property values are determined by a large variety of factors so more features may improve the model
# Next Steps
* If provided more time to work on the project I would want to explore more features to develop a better model
