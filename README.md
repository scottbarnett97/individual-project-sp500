# Individual-Project- S&P 500 up or down

## Executive summanry
* Big idea:
    * Explore if there is enough data provided by the yfinance python library to create a model that reliably predicts which days to buy into S&P 500 tied products by redicting if thir value will be up the next day.
* Goals: 
    * Discover key drivers of market movement in the data set
    * Use them to create a ML model to predict which days are targeted buy days
* Key findings:
    * The features provided by yfinance which we evaluated are all related to predicting target buy days
    * However, they are not strong enought to create a reliable model to base investment decisions on
    * Random forest was our best model beating basline by only 0.1%
* Recomendations:
    * Daily news, government policies, and international events all play a role in market movement
    * Using advaced AI and NLP models to incorporate this information into a model would likely prove useful
    * Do not use the current model for making investment decisions
    
## Description
* We want to be able to predict what days to buy the S&P 500 based on it being up or down by close the next day

## Background Info
* The S&P 500 is a stock market index composed of 500 large companies having common stock listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) or Nasdaq. Founded in 1923, it is now considered one of the best overall indicators of the US stock market.
* There are several investment vehicles offered by various companies that aim to mimic the composition of the S&P 500 and are tradeble under ticker symbols like SPY and SPX
* For this project we will use ^GSPC, which is Yahoo Finance's 'proprietary' ticker for the S&P 500 index. 
    * However, it must be remembered that ^GSPC is a price index and is not tradeable. It only shows the movement of stock prices in the S&P 500 index.

## GoalsÂ¶
* Construct an ML model that predicts S&P 500 Up or Down
* Find the key drivers of S&P 500 movement.
* Deliver a report that the data science team can read through and replicate, understand what steps were taken, why and what the outcome was.
* Make recommendations on what works or doesn't work in predicting the S&P 500 movement up or down.

## Initial hypotheses and/or questions you have of the data, ideas
There should be some combination of features that can be used to build a predictive model wheter the S&P 500 will be up or down on a given day
* 1. Is trade volume predictive of target buy days?
* 2. Is the daily high value predictive of target buy days?
* 3. Are daily opening values predictive of target buy days? 
* 4. Are daily low values predictive of target buy days?  
*****************************************
## Project Plan 
* Acquire data from Yahoo Finance 
* Prepare data
    * Drop data prior to 1990 
        * Modern electronic trading dramatically chaged access to the markets
        * This caused a major change in market behaviors 
        * dropping this data will keep the model from favoring 70 years of data that generally no longer apply 
        * NASDAQ introduced electronic trading inthe 1980's, but the NYSE didn't begin using them until the 90's
    * drop last row containing null value as that is what we are trying to predict 
    * Create Engineered columns from existing data
        * created tommorrw column based on the close price for today 
        * created a target colum that is the encoded up(1) or down(0) value 1 indicating a day to buy stock with a predicted rise in price the next day

*** Explore data in search of drivers of S&P 500 movement
    **** Answer the following initial questions
        ***** 1. Is trade volume predictive of target buy days?
        ***** 2. Is the daily high value predictive of target buy days?
        ***** 3. Are daily opening values predictive of target buy days? 
        ***** 4. Are daily low values predictive of target buy days?  
*** Develop a model to predict what day to buy stock on S&P500 movement up or down
*** Draw conclusions

## Data Dictionary

| Feature | Datatype | Key | Definition |
|---|---|---|---|
| Date | object | Unique | Date of trading activity |
| High | float64 | in USD | The highest value reached that day |
| Low | float64 | in USD | The lowest value reached that day |
| Close | float64 | in USD | The value at the time the market opened |
| Open | float64 | in USD | The value at the time the market opened |
| Volume | int64 | count | The total number of shares traded that day |
| Tomorrow | float64 | in USD | The closing price the next day |
| Target | int64 | 1 = Yes  <br>0 = No | Day you should buy because the value is expected to rise the next day |
## Steps to Reproduce
* 1. Clone this repo
* 2. Acquire the data from yfinance 
    * use terminal to run pip install yfinance 
    * add import yfinance as yf to your libraries
* 3. (can skip if intalling yfinance and importing library) Put the 'sp500.csv' in the file containing the cloned repo or run the report.  
* 4. Run notebook
* 5. Note: Your imported csv. will contain data between my import date and yours 
    * Option 1: you can delete the additional rows to match 
    * Option 2: accept that they are there and may cause minute changes to results- these should be insignificant overall
    
## Takeaways and Conclusions
* The features provided by yfinance which we evaluated are all related to predicting target buy days
* However, our model was not able to really outperform the market at a rate that would cause me to use it for actual investment puposes
* There was little opportunity for feature engineering for a cagorization model
* Our best model was Random Forest

# Recomendations
* The model provided did beat our baseline, but not by any significant amouunt
* I would not recommend this model based solely on readily availble features provided by Yahoo Finance's yfinance library for making investmet decisions
# Next Steps
* If provided more time to work on the project there are a number of possible things that could be considered
    * USA market hours occour after asian and european markets, their performance could proide useful information for our model
    * Daily news can also play a major role, so incorporating some NLP techniques could improve the model
    * Government policies play a big role in market directionality, so incorporating those available data sets should prove useful
* Investigate if using time series models would be more successful
